The choice between the two approaches depends on factors such as the complexity of the dataset, the dynamics of the training process, and the desired trade-off between simplicity and adaptability in the learning process.




addition of Batch Normalization and Dropout layers enhances the baseline VGG16-like model by improving convergence speed, reducing overfitting, and enhancing its ability to generalize to new datasets.
